# :keyboard: KEYHOARD JOTTEL : GMTK BUILD SOURCE CODE :keyboard:
![banner](pics/GMTK20_COVER.png)
### A source code of my metroidvania game with a twist : every item and upgrades uses your limited slots of keys on your keyboard, also an entry for [GMTK Game Jam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020), written in 48 hours over the span of a weekend in 2020, July.
### :point_right: See the game's [itch.io page](https://zikbakguru.itch.io/jottel) and the game's [submission page (rates & feedbacks are highly appreciated)](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020/rate/699095) :point_left:

## The game features...
* Retro CRT effect, achieved with GLSL ES shaders
* Items & upgrades that once picked up, must be assigned to your available key on your keyboard (some upgrades even requires the user to press the assigned key in order to use it, for example : if you assigned your jump upgrades to Z button, you have to press Z in order to jump)
* Cliche-esque upgrades that is present in almost every single Metroidvania games, Including the good old jump, sprint, shoot etc..
* Kicking move that lets players to climb the wall by succesive wall-kicking
* C64-inspired sprite graphics
* Grahpics & sound & music assets carefully handcrafted by me

## Also included : the project files for the game's map, sound effects and music.

They're conveniently placed inside of `/ASSETS` folder. The map file (`.tmx` file) can be opened with [Tiled map editor](https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled), The sound effect file (`.lch` files) can be opened with sfx synthesizer [LabChirp](https://labbed.itch.io/labchirp), And the music file (`loop1.kt` file) can be opened with music tracker [Klystrack](https://kometbomb.itch.io/klystrack).

## :warning: Warning : Since this build is the exact same build as the gamejam build, This game contains various flaws! (for example; players can softlock the game by either falling out of bounds using the kicking moves or leaving the essential upgrades in a unreachable places) :warning:
